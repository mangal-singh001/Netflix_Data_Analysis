🎬 Netflix Data Analysis

This project dives deep into Netflix's content catalog to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

> The aim is to explore how Netflix content has evolved over the years — in terms of content types, genres, release patterns, and global distribution.



📌 Project Objective

* Analyze the types of content available on Netflix (TV Shows vs Movies)
* Explore top countries contributing to Netflix’s library
* Visualize genre popularity, release year trends, and content rating distribution
* Discover patterns in director & cast frequency
* Generate actionable insights for content creators or marketing teams
